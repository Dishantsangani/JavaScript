# Js Notes

1. Variable
   Variable is hold the data values

2. Data Type
   DataType Is a variables Values Type.
   2.Type of Datatype

   1. Primitive (Number,String,Boolean,Null,Undefined) = It's Primitive Datatype is inmutable (like:Value are Not Change)
   2. Non-Primitive(Array, Object) = It's A Refrence Datatype is Mutable (Like:Value are Change)

3. Operators
   Operators are perform some Operation On values.

4. Control Flow

   1. if_else
      if else is allows you to execute a block of code based on a specified condition.

   2. Swich Case
      Switch is used to perform different actions based on different conditions,
   3. Loop's
      Loops allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times

5. Function
   Function are performe a task and calculation on value

6. Array
   Array Are Container To Store Diffrence Type Of Data

7. Object
   Object Are stored A Data and Value In key Value pair

8. Scope

   Scope in JavaScript refers to the area of your code where variables and functions can be accessed.
   â€¢ There are 4 Type's Of Scope

   1. Global Scope : Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.
   2. Local Scope : Variables declared inside a function are in the local scope.
   3. Block Scope : Variables declared with let or const inside curly braces {} can only be accessed within those braces.
   4. Lexical Scope : lexical scoping, meaning that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code.

9. closure
   Closure in JavaScript is when a function remembers and has access to variables from its outer function or scope, even after the outer function has finished runnin

10. Hoisting
    Hoisting is variable and function declarations are automatically moved to the top of the code by JavaScript before the code runs.

11. Aync / Await

    1. Aync it can perform tasks in the background without blocking the main code

    2. Await It tells the program to "wait" for a specific task to finish before moving on to the next line of code.

12. Promise
    Promise in JavaScript is like a guarantee that something will happen in the future.

    1. Pending: The operation is still in progress.
    2. Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
    3. Rejected: The operation failed.

13. Callback
    Callback function is passed into another Function as an Argument

14. Events
    Event is something that happens or occurs, often in response to an action

15. Dom Manupulation
    DOM manipulation refers to the process of changing the structure, content, or style of a web page using JavaScript

16. Ajax And Fetch Api
    AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.

17. Error Handling (Try & Catch)

    1. Try An event is something that happens or occurs, often in response to an action
    2. Catch error and run the code inside the catch block instead of crashing.

18. Higher Order Function's
    A Function that takes a Function as an argument.

19. Module and modularization
    is a file that contains code (functions, variables, classes) that you can use in other parts of your application.

20. JSON
    JSON is Lightweight Format used To stored and share data

    1. OOP
       is a way to structure and organize code by using objects.

21. ES6 + Destructuring
    Destructuring is a way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a simpler, shorter syntax.

22. Bom and Dom
    Bom = Browser Object Model represents additional object provided by the browser

23. Regular Expressions
    Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match, find, or manipulate text

24. Functional Programming concepts
    1. Find
       Method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.
    2. Some
       Method return the value is passed in test that return in true or false
    3. Every
       Method is return the value is passed in test all value that return true
    4. Map
       Method is return new array of existing array.
    5. Filter  
       Method is return new array of he passed in array condition
    6. Reduce
       Method is return the total of array element
    7. ForEach
       Method is used to execute a provided function once for each element in an array
    8. includes
       Method is Match the Value of exisiting value of array
